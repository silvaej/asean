    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we get into anything further, this is an important disclaimer. ‘Indonesia’ is
      a singular term that names a particular nation, but there’s nothing uniform about its culture. There are at least
      300 ethnic groups in Indonesia, each with their own set of customs and distinctive cultural objects. That doesn’t
      mean there aren’t any similarities or tendencies between one culture to the other, but when reading this phrase
      keep in mind the diversity that comes with it. Often what considered as Indonesia’s culture is in fact an image of
      a dominant one or reflects an amalgamation of certain similar cultures.

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No matter how old or independent they are, Indonesians tend to keep tight
      relationships with members of their family. For many Indonesian youths, moving out of parents’ house is simply not
      a thing, even when they already have a stable income of their own. Many choose to live under their parents’ roof
      unless they absolutely have to (many Indonesians leave their hometown to get a job in the city). And it’s not
      necessarily a sign of dependency, it just shows the values and principles the nation has when it comes to family.

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some households even consist of extended family — you’ll see grandparents, aunties,
      uncles, and nieces living together or staying in the same neighborhood just to be close to each other.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in Indonesia, you’ll see Balinese present their offerings first thing in the
      morning, or employees dropping everything for prayer time. No matter what religion they uphold, Indonesians are
      generally very spiritual. They take their religious practices very seriously, and that is reflected in daily
      rituals, ceremonies, even the grandness of their places of worship.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia is notorious with its huge Muslim population; the largest in the world
      despite being a secular country by law. But Islam is just one of six official religions acknowledged in the
      country — Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. In Bali, for example, the
      dominant religion is Hinduism, and there are localities where there are more Christians than Muslims.

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia’s diversity extends to the variety of belief systems as well. Many
      communities still live traditionally and still uphold the religions and practices of their ancestors, often unique
      to the locality. But to categorize, many belief systems draw from animism, dynamism, and totemism. In some
      communities, those beliefs interact with traditions or influenced by another mainstream religion, resulting in a
      myriad of unique practices.

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since its earliest history, Indonesians have always been communal. Farmers work
      together to cultivate their lands and manage resources, villages keep close-knit communities and take care of each
      other, and cultural values push forward principles of collectivism. Even in modern settings like the office
      workplace and modern communities, you’ll see the inclusiveness and friendliness of Indonesians.

    </div>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The archipelago is rich with herbs and spices, which shape traditional recipes to
      utilize the abundance of those ingredients. In fact, many Indonesian dishes may come out strong to tourists’
      tongues. Recipes do vary from one locality to another, according to the main crops in the area. Javanese, for
      instance, tend to like sweeter meals due to the abundance of cane and palm sugar. But many other locales like
      Padang, Manado, and Bali, sure do not hold back on their chili and spices.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s fascinating to learn the geological processes that make mountains, hills, and
      rivers. But Indonesians go beyond tectonic plates and erosion to explain how natural landmarks came to be. In most
      places, you can talk to the locals and dig stories of gods, spirits, royals, or hermits that contribute to the
      forming of a particular spot like natural features, temples, or other cultural landmarks.</p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a child’s first step on the ground to certain months of pregnancy, many
      cultures in Indonesia has special ceremonies for even the tiniest milestones. Many cultures also make a huge deal
      out of life events like weddings and funerals, mixing them with mesmerizing traditional customs and celebrations.
      There are also communal celebrations like a myriad of different ceremonies of harvest or thanksgiving, and special
      dates associated with legends or history.

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sure you don’t often hear the rituals of maturity in Indonesia on this one.
      Not surprisingly, because the term “Metatah” itself is taken from the Balinese language. Actually, if you know the
      meaning, we’re sure you’ve heard of it!
      <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metatah itself in Balinese is a tradition of cutting teeth. This typical Balinese
      maturity ceremony is not only called Metatah, you know.
      <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other names such as Mepandes and Mesangih are also often used in the mention of
      this tooth-cutting ceremony. Metatah itself is one of well-known Indonesian cultural activities, in Bali of
      course. No wonder, this tradition becomes one of top traditions in Bali.
      <br><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly speaking, this social culture in Bali is a religious ceremony performed by
      adherents of Hinduism in Bali when a child is growing up from his teenage years.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And no, we’re not talking about those living in traditional remote villages. Many
      Indonesians who find themselves in modern settings still find ways to integrate their traditions and cultural
      values into the contemporary lifestyle. Some companies still consult traditional almanacs or spiritual elders to
      determine a good day to do business, and many young professionals still throw traditional ceremonies for their
      weddings, whether out of the family’s demands or out of their own volition, but the traditions live on.

      sculpture, music, dance, theatre, and more. From the ancient times to contemporary era, Indonesian artists keep

      types, this leather puppets and also the golek puppet, which has the three dimentional form. Usualy the golek
      puppet came from Sundanese culture.
      <br><br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indonesia textiles come in a dazzling variety of fabrics, materials, technique,
      colour and motifs. Basically there are three major textiles groupings: ikat, songket and batik. The Indonesian
      word ikat, which means to tie or bind, is used as the name for intricately patterned cloth whose threads are
      tie-dyed by a vaer painstaking and skillful process before they are woven together. Second, Songket, Songket is
      silk cloth with gold or silver threads woven into it, although these days imitation silver or gold is often used.
      Third, Batik is a method of producing designs by using waxing and dying techniques.
