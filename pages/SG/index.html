            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign island
            city-state in maritime Southeast Asia. It lies about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles)
            north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Straits of Malacca to the
            west, the Riau Islands (Indonesia) to the south, and the South China Sea to the east.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After early years of turbulence and despite lacking natural resources and a
            hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers based on external trade,
            becoming a highly developed country; it is ranked ninth on the UN Human Development Index and has the
            second-highest GDP per capita (PPP) in the world. Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA sovereign
            rating from all major rating agencies. It is a major financial and shipping hub, consistently ranked the
            most expensive city to live in since 2013, and has been identified as a tax haven. Singapore is placed
            highly in key social indicators: education, healthcare, quality of life, personal safety, and housing, with
            a home-ownership rate of 91%. Singaporeans enjoy one of the world's longest life expectancies, fastest
            Internet connection speeds and one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world.
