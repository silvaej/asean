    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore's amazing tale tells of a once sleepy fishing village that defied the odds to transform itself into a first-world metropolis. There are few places in the world that have transformed themselves from a humble trading port to a first-world metropolis in the short span of five decades.</div>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One key attraction is the massive architectural model that gives you a bird's eye view of the city centre, which comes alive with a light and sound show. Another key attraction allows you to immerse yourself in the city through a 270-degree panoramic show that depicts scenes of daily life in Singapore from dusk to dawn.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may also want to check out the other interactive activities to get a taste of city planning and insights into the country's conservation efforts. It's a multi-sensory experience that takes you deep into Singapore's exciting planning journey.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a sober reminder of war’s violence, Changi Chapel and Museum stands as testament to the tenacity of the human spirit. </p>

	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With donations and loans from families of the internees, the museum now showcases 114 artefacts across eight exhibition zones, delving into their daily lives, struggles and liberation upon the conclusion of the war.
    </p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The museum’s first four zones document the evolution of Changi from the 19th century to the 1920s, the fall of Singapore during World War II, and the lives of soldiers and POWs imprisoned at Changi.
    </p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	The latter four zones delve more deeply into the everyday lives of the internees, documenting their resilience and creativity amid hardship, their subsequent liberation, and their legacies after the war.

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have time to visit only one place to learn about the history and culture of Singapore, this is probably it. The National Museum of Singapore tells you the intriguing story of this country in a manner that is both fun and rewarding.
Imagine standing in the midst of a vast darkened space surrounded by a massive video montage showing everyday life in Singapore while a rousing symphony plays in the background. That’s just a taste of the immersive experience you can expect here.

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its history dating back to 1887, the National Museum of Singapore is the nation’s oldest, and one of the city’s architectural icons. Its permanent offerings, the Singapore Gallery and Life in Singapore: The Past 100 Years galleries, piece together the past and present in a compelling narrative. The building itself is a wondrous structure that has seamlessly fused the old with the new, enhancing the elegant neo-classical building with a new modernist extension of glass and metal.

    </p>
	
	<p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The museum hosts a dynamic range of events through the year—from art installations and festivals to performances and film screenings—in addition to presenting exhibitions involving historically and culturally important collections of artefacts. One of the latest immersive art installations – Story of the Forest by teamLab allows visitors to experience the treasured collections of the Museum being brought to life through a spectacular digital presentation.
