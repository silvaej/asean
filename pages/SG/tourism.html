  <div class="synop">To date, this country has become my most visited country in Southeast Asia thanks to frequent promo
    fares & direct flights from major airports. The best places & things to do in Singapore are attractions that
    showcase the city’s rich multi-cultural heritage, innovative modernity and drive to harmonize nature with its dense
    urban landscape.<br><br>

    If you’re on your way to this bustling city-state, I hope this these tips will help you make the most out of travel
    experience.</div>

              a high-end luxury hotel, a mall with a canal running through it, the ArtScience Museum, and the Marina Bay
              Sands Skypark Observation Deck–a vantage point for taking in the entire city. The Skypark's viewing deck
              and infinity pool are found in the ship (yes, ship) that tops the hotel. Only hotel guests are allowed to
              use the infinity pool, but anyone can visit the observation deck.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Skypark, you can see the innovative double helix bridge, the port,
              the Gardens by the Bay (101 hectares of land converted into waterfront gardens), and the impressive
              skyline.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While up there on top of the city, guests can grab a snack or a coffee at
              the rooftop restaurant or pick up some keepsakes from the souvenir stand. You can purchase a photo of
              yourself green-screened in front of the massive hotel as it's all lit up at night, but the cost is steep
              at 50 Singapore dollars–better to ask a fellow tourist to snap a photo of you if possible. The elegant
              opulence of the Marina Bay Sands exemplifies Singapore's style and status as a major international city in
              Southeast Asia.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You won't want to miss Supertree Grove, where you'll find a cluster of the
              iconic, futuristic structures designed to perform environmentally sustainable functions. Then, head to the
              Cloud Forest Dome to see the world's tallest indoor waterfall and learn a bit about biodiversity. Check

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to be confused with the Gardens on the Bay, the Botanic Gardens are also
              worth a visit. Singapore received its first UNESCO World Heritage nomination for its botanical gardens,
              and with good reason. The city can sometimes feel like a concrete jungle, albeit a clean and comfortable
              one, but the botanic gardens preserve pieces of Singapore's wilder heritage.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, a walking trail leads to the gardens' heritage trees, which are
              conserved as part of an effort to protect the city's mature tree species. Make sure to visit the
              impressive National Orchid Garden as well. <br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other popular things to do include visiting the eco-garden, eco-lake, bonsai
              garden, sculptures, and several other formal gardens.

            <td class="content-desc">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Billing itself as the world's best rainforest zoo,
              the Singapore Zoo is a pretty impressive place. The facility is clean and inviting, and the animals appear
              well treated, with plenty of lush vegetation and habitat space.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orangutans are particularly impressive, and visitors can watch as babies
              and adults alike swing high above their platforms and snack on fruits. There is also a large chimpanzee
              family, zebras, meerkats, a komodo dragon, mole rats, white tigers, kangaroos, and many other
              creatures.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guests can observe feedings for some of the animals. Allow at least three
              hours to make your way around the zoo.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the zoo doesn't satisfy your need for getting close to wildlife, there's
              also the Night Safari, River Safari (including a giant panda forest), and the Jurong Bird Park. Park
              hopper passes are available if you plan to visit more than one of the wildlife parks.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One could be forgiven for coming to Singapore and doing nothing but
              shopping, as this is a world-class city for style and designer chic. The Orchard Road area is a great
              place to start a shopping spree, as there are high-end stores at every turn. You'd expect nothing less
              from a neighborhood that boasts 22 malls and six department stores. There are also four movie theaters,
              including an IMAX cinema, and a KTV karaoke establishment.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you get hungry while burning through all that cash, there are plenty of
              eateries in the neighborhood serving international food.

              world's largest giant observation wheel. Choose from several different packages that allow you to be

              as the Spice Islands of Indonesia and Malaysia's Straits of Johor.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several different ticket packages to choose from, and each
              includes access to the multimedia Journey of Dreams exhibit, which delves into Singapore's history and the
              creation of the Singapore Flyer.<br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flights last 30 minutes and run from early morning until late at night, so
              you can choose which view of the city you want to enjoy: the beginning of another bustling day or when
              Singapore is aglow after dark.

              but if you're really craving some fun in the sun, Sentosa Island is the place to find it. Siloso Beach is
              a good spot for getting in beach time, and visitors can play volleyball on free courts or go kayaking and
              skimboarding. There are several other beach attractions as well, plus an Underwater World aquarium, where
              you can swim with dolphins. <br><br>

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A must-see on Sentosa Island is the Merlion, Singapore's famous statue that
              has the head of a lion and the body of a fish. You can take an escalator to the top of the statue and
              enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding area. Adventurous types will want to check out The Flying Trapeze
              and the SeaBreeze Water-Sports @ Wave House, where you can try your hand at flying strapped to a
              water-propelled jet pack.
