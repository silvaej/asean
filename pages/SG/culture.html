    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Singapore’s physical facade goes through multiple changes constantly, there are still key identifiers in terms of identity and specifically in terms of culture that have gone unchanged. From the unique variant of English to impressive cleanliness and the plethora of fines, here’s what you should know about the island state’s culture.</div>

    Culture</div>

  <div class="intro_culture">
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culture of Singapore is a melange of Malay, South Asian, Southeast Asian and Eurasian culture and influences. The quintessential cosmopolitan, Singaporean culture has transformed greatly over the years. The indigenous culture of Singapore was originally influenced by Austronesian people who arrived here from Taiwan. During the course of many years, Singapore's culture was further influenced and inspired by multiple Chinese dynasties and other Asian countries which have eventually given shape to the eccentric and striking Singaporean culture that we see today.

      Customs & Traditions
    </div>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite being small-sized, the local customs and cultures of Singapore are a blend of multiple ethnic influences including Chinese, Malay, Indians and others, the reason being the country's history as a trading hub. This diversity is also reflected in terms of spoken languages which include English, Mandarin, Tamil and Malay. Some popular Singaporean customs and traditions are:

    <br>
	<ul>
	<li>While meeting a Singaporean formally or informally, make sure to shake hands firmly with all, even when departing. A slight bow while shaking hands is considered respectful. 
	<li>Take off the shoes before entering anyone's house. Also, remember to take them off before visiting any temple or mosque.
	<li>Make sure never to pinpoint someone or something with a finger, just raise your hand for indication. 
	<li>Gender discrimination is a legal offence in Singapore; thus, take care not to disrespect anyone. 
	<li>Tipping is not customary in Singapore. Most of the restaurants add a 10% service charge in the bill, in which case, tipping is generally discouraged. Avoid tipping at hawker centres and food courts. Tipping is also completely prohibited at the Changi Airport. 
	<li>Refer to the middle-aged and elderly people as 'Uncle' or 'Auntie', as it is seen as a sign of respect in Singapore. 
	<li>While eating with chopsticks, do not stick them upright in the bowl. It is reminiscent of funeral rites and considered bad luck. 
	<li>Do not touch anyone's head, as it is considered sacred by many. On the contrary, the feet are regarded as dirty, so do not point them directly at someone. 
	<li>Casual clothes (shorts, t-shirts, flip-flops) are acceptable in most places in Singapore. Pack formal outfit and dress shoes for higher-end restaurants.

      Cleanliness
    </div>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore is by far one of the cleanest countries, not only in Asia but the rest of the world. Starting right from the spick and span Changi Airport right up to the spotless streets and by-lanes, there is absolutely no littering anywhere. To maintain the cleanliness, chewing gum is banned in Singapore. Since an open trade agreement with the USA in 2004, only a limited amount of medical chewing gums are allowed, but that too has to be prescribed by a dentist. </p>

      Queuing in Singapore 
    </div>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singaporeans value discipline more than anything. They have no issue with standing in a queue for something that is good. Everywhere else we tend not to queue because as humans we have the need to get that something before someone else gets it, but Singaporeans know that it’s a waste of time and a hassle to not be in a queue and so, in Singapore, you get to see some of the most orderly queues you can find.

      Religion
    </div>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese Buddhism happens to be the major religion in Singapore, owing to the large population of Southern Chinese immigrants and their descendants. Hinduism is also prevalent, being the faith of those with South Indian heritage. Christianity is growing quite exponentially as a belief system, and many young Singaporeans are leaning towards it. <br><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below is a picture of the Buddah	Tooth Relic Temple in Singapore.

      Language of Singapore
    </div>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singapore has four official languages – English, Malay, Tamil and Mandarin Chinese. Being a former colonial country, English is the most commonly spoken and written language. It is the lingua franca in Singapore and therefore the de facto language used in public service and administration, trade and commerce and in the judicial system. In writing, Singapore follows British English. However, the spoken colloquial version of Singaporean English is locally called “Singlish”. Although Malay is the national language of the country, only 15-17% of Singaporeans speak the language. It is officially present in the Singaporean national anthem, in military commands and in orders and citations only. Most people in the country are bilingual - they can speak reasonably good English and one of the three other languages as their mother tongue

      Festivals
    </div>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culture of Singapore is highly influenced by a large number of religious festivities taking place all around the year. August 9 is the country’s Independence Day, which is celebrated with the National Day Parade since 2005. Other than this, the public holiday list of Singapore is a reflection of the country’s racial, religious and linguistic diversity. Among the assured ones, there is Chinese New Year, Eid-ul-Fitr, Diwali and Buddhist Vesak Day or the Death of Buddha, as well as Good Friday, Christmas and New Year’s Day. Other celebrated festivals are Pongal, Thaipusam, Buddha Jayanti and Hari Raya Haji. </p>

	<div class="c_picture" style="background-image:url(images/culture11.jpg);"></div>
	<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among cultural festivals, there is Singapore Food Festival every year from June-end to July-end, Singapore Art Festival every January, and Singapore Night Festival which comes alive with different themes every year for two weekends in August, at Bras Basah Bugis art enclave. The Buddhists celebrate the Hungry Ghost Festival and offer eatables to the spirits of their deceased. Between May and June, the Dragon Boat Festival or the Zhongxao Festival in Chinese takes place at Bedok Reservoir, where dragon-shaped boats oared by a dozen or so people aside, compete in the race. Mid-Autumn Festival or the Lantern Festival is one of the largest celebrations in the country, which marks the 15th and the last day of Chinese New Year festivities. The sky of Singapore gets covered with flaming dots of paper lanterns set free.
