            Philippines is a Southeast Asian island nation in the western Pacific Ocean. It is an archipelago of about
            7,000 islands and islets located around 500 miles (800 kilometers) off the coast of Vietnam. Although Manila
            is the country's capital, Quezon City is its most populous city. Both are located on Luzon, the largest
            island, and are part of the National Capital Region (Metro Manila).

            The Philippine Sea to the east, the Celebes Sea to the south, the Sulu Sea to the southwest, and the South
            China Sea to the west and north define the boundaries of the Philippine archipelago. The islands form a
            triangle, with the Batan Islands to the north of Luzon creating its apex and the Sulu Archipelago to the
            south of Palawan, the Sulu Archipelago, and the island of Mindanao constituting its southern base (from west
            to east, respectively).
