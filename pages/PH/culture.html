        <div class="blog-title">The Philippine Culture</div><br><br>
        <div class="blog-content">Filipino culture is very distinct and considered rich and diversified. According to
            Dumaraos (2018), there are a few things about Philippine culture that make it different from the rest of the
            world. She listed these things and will be discussed in this article.</div><br><br>
        <div class="blog-content">First, Filipinos are well-known for their huge spirit of resiliency. They always
            manage to rise above different challenges such as calamities, catastrophes and instead of wallowing, they
            manage to pick themselves up and put a big happy smile on their faces. Filipinos take pride in their
            families. In the Philippines, the people are very family-oriented, and they prioritize their family first.
            Sometimes, even the closest of friends are considered family too.</div><br><br>
        <div class="blog-content">Filipinos are very religious as well. In all corners of a Filipino house, you can find
            brazen images of crosses and other religious paraphernalia. They go to church every Sunday, or sometimes
            even twice or three times a week.</div><br><br>
        <div class="blog-content">Filipino people are very respectful as well as from the moment they are born into this
            world, they are taught already how to be respectful by using simple catchphrases like “po” and “opo”
            especially when addressing elders. They have a culture of “pagmamano” or raising the backs of the hand of
            their elders to their foreheads, again as a sign of utmost respect.</div><br><br>
        <div class="blog-content">They also have this culture of “bayanihan” or “community spirit” where Filipinos help
            one another without expecting anything in return. Filipinos are very helpful and selfless. The Filipino
            people also value traditions and culture. For them, traditions at the home and in their family are
            important. </div><br><br>
        <div class="blog-content">They usually set aside a specific day for a certain celebration like festivals,
            birthday parties, reunions, etc. And of course, every gathering is dedicated to keeping up with each other
            over sumptuous food. On the other hand, in the Philippines, they love to hold different celebrations or
            fiestas. Every part of the country has its own kind of festival especially to honor their patron saint or to
            celebrate abundance in agriculture and such. For example, Bacolod has its Maskara Festival, Davao has its
            Kadayawan Festival and Marinduque has its own Moriones Festival. These are just a few examples.</div>
        <br><br>
        <div class="blog-content">Filipinos also have the longest Christmas celebrations ever. Even as early as August,
            you can hear Christmas songs and jingles being played in the malls or in the restaurants in the Philippines.
            The mood becomes festive, with many people shopping and in good spirits. Christmas celebrations last until
            around the first or second week of January.</div><br><br>
        <div class="blog-content">Filipinos are very fond of eating. Aside from breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Filipinos
            manage to squeeze in a little meal in between, too. Whether they eat every hour or every three hours, they
            savor every bite. They also love to sing, and therefore karaoke has become so prevalent and favored in the
            country. As part of their recreation, Filipinos spend time with their families and friends singing or
            belting out new and old songs.</div><br><br>
        <div class="blog-content">Filipinos also love art and architecture. Just look at the massive and tall buildings
            everywhere. Filipinos have a penchant for bringing art and architecture to a whole new level. They love to
            design creatively, think intuitively and have a passion for anything different and unique.</div>
