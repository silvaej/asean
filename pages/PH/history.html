        <br>
        <div class="blog-content">The Philippines were a Spanish province for over 300 years and were named after King
            Philip II of Spain (1556-1598). Now, the Philippines is a 7,000-island archipelago. However, it is believed
            that at the beginning of the third century, the inhabitants of Luzon Island is in contract and trading with
            East Asian seafarers and merchants, especially the Chinese. The Japanese also constructed a trading post in
            Aparri, Northern Luzon, in the 1400s.</div><br>

        <div class="blog-content">Hunter-gatherers were the early inhabitants of the Philippines. People did,
            however,
            learn to cultivate between 3,000 and 2,000 BC. Rice was grown, and domesticated animals were kept.
            Filipinos
            began trading with China in the 10th century AD, and by the 12th century AD, Arab traders had arrived in
            the
            Philippines, bringing Islam with them.</div><br>
        <div class="blog-content">Then in 1521, Ferdinand Magellan traveled across the Pacific. When he arrived in
            the
            Philippines, he claimed the islands for Spain. Magellan baptized a leader named Humabon intending to use
            him
            as a puppet ruler for the Spanish crown. Other chiefs were ordered to submit to Humabon by Magellan, but
            one
            chief, Lapu Lapu, refused. Magellan commanded a troop to annihilate him. The Spanish soldiers, on the
            other
            hand, were dispersed, and Magellan was murdered.</div><br>

        <div class="blog-content">The Spaniards did not establish a foothold in the Philippines until 1565 when
            Miguel
            Lopez de Legazpi led an expedition to Cebu and established a fort. The Spaniards arrived in Luzon in
            1571.
            They established the city of Intramuros (later known as Manila), which became the Philippines' capital.
            Luzon was captured by Spanish conquistadors who marched inland. They established a feudal order.
            Spaniards
            owned vast estates worked by Filipinos.</div><br>

        <div class="blog-content">Friars joined the conquistadors who then converted the Filipinos to Catholicism.
            Schools and universities were also created by the friars. The years in the Philippines proceeded
            uneventfully until the British seized Manila in 1762. They kept it for two years, but under the
            conditions
            of the Treaty of Paris, signed in 1763, they hand it back in 1764.</div><br>

        <div class="blog-sub-title">The Philippines in the 19th Century</div><br>
        <div class="blog-content">A rebellion sprang out in Cavite in 1872, but it was promptly put down. However,
            with
            the help of a writer named Jose Rizal (1861-1896), nationalist sentiments continued to rise. He fueled
            the
            embers of nationalism with his writings Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not) and El Filibusterismo (The
            Filibusterer). Jose Rizal founded the La Liga Filipina movement in 1892, which advocated for reform
            rather
            than revolution. Rizal was imprisoned and deported to Dapitan, Mindanao, as a result.</div><br>

        <div class="caption">Members of La Liga Filipina</div><br>
        <div class="blog-content">Meanwhile, Andres Bonifacio founded the Katipunan, a more extreme organization.
            They
            started a revolt in August 1896. Jose Rizal, who did not support the revolution but was accused of doing
            so,
            was executed on December 30, 1896. Yet his execution merely enraged Filipinos and fueled the revolution.

        <div class="caption">Execution of Rizal at Bagumbayan</div><br>
        <div class="blog-content">Later on, Emilio Aguinaldo, head of the Katipuneros in Cavite Province drafted a
            constitution and formed the Republic of Biak-na-Bato in Bulacan province. In 1897, an impasse between
            the
            Spanish government and Aguinaldo arose. After discussions between the two parties, Aguinaldo accepted an
            amnesty from the Spaniards and US$800,000 in exchange for his exile to Hong Kong with his government.
        </div><br>
        <div class="blog-content">Then in 1898 came the war between the USA and Spain. On May 1, 1898, the Americans
            under the command of U.S. Admiral George Dewey of the United States Navy fought the Spanish Navy in
            Manila
            Bay with the help of Emilio Aguinaldo. Faced with defeat, Spain gave the Philippines to the United
            States in
            1898 in exchange for a payment of US$ 20 million as part of the "Treaty of Paris" that ended the
            Spanish-American War. Filipinos led by Emilio Aguinaldo declared independence on June 12, 1898. </div>

            announcement. On February 4, 1899, a war broke out between American forces in Manila and the Filipinos.
            The
            Philippine-American War lasted until Aguinaldo was captured in 1902.</div><br>

        <div class="blog-content">American rule was paternalistic. “Benevolent Assimilation” was the name of their
            policy. They attempted to “Americanize” the Filipinos, but they never quite succeeded. They did,
            however, do
            some good. Many American teachers were dispatched to the Philippines on the ship Thomas, and they were
            successful in increasing literacy. The Philippines became a commonwealth and became semi-independent in
            1935. Manuel Quezon was elected President of the Philippines. In 1945, the United States guaranteed that
            the
            Philippines would be entirely independent. </div><br>

            The
            Philippines were invaded by Japanese soldiers on December 10, 1941. On January 2, 1941, they took
            Manila.
            All of the Philippines had been under Japanese control by May 6, 1942. In October 1944, however,
            American
            troops returned to the Philippines. In February 1945, they retook Manila.</div><br>

        <div class="blog-content">The Philippines became independent on 4 July 1946. Manuel Roxas was sworn in as
            the
            first President of the Republic of the Philippines. Roxas passed away in April of 1948. Elpidio Quirino
            took
            over as his successor. Both Roxas and Quirino had to deal with the Hukbalahap, a powerful anti-Japanese
            guerrilla group that turned militant and tarnished the ruling class. Ramon Magsaysay finally put an end
            to
            the organization, which is Pres. Quirino's Secretary of Defense. In the 1953 elections, Magsaysay
            defeated
            Quirino. He was a popular president who was well-liked by the general public. Carlos Garcia succeeded
            Magsaysay after he died in an airplane disaster on March 17, 1957.</div><br>
        <div class="blog-content">In 1965, Ferdinand E. Marcos became the first president of the Philippines to be
            re-elected for a second term. He launched a massive public works program and remained popular throughout
            his
            first term. Due to alleged dishonesty in the 1969 campaign, the loss in economic growth, government
            corruption, and decreasing peace and order, his popularity began to dwindle after his re-election. In
            1972,
            near the end of his second and final term in government, he declared martial law. Senator Benigno
            "Ninoy"
            Aquino and Senator Jose Diokno, both staunch opponents, were among the first to be imprisoned. With the
            help
            of the military, Marcos maintained an iron grip on the country during the Martial Law years. The
            legislature
            was abolished, and opposition leaders were imprisoned. </div>

        <div class="caption">Declaration of Martial Law in Malacañang Palace</div>
        <br>
        <div class="blog-content">Marcos called an election in February 1986. The opposition united behind Cory
            Aquino,
            Benigno's widow. Marcos was declared the winner (a clear case of electoral fraud). Ordinary people came
            to
            the streets to demonstrate their support for Cory Aquino, who also declared victory. Marcos' supporters
            deserted him, and he surrendered to the inevitable and went into exile. Corazon Aquino's life did not
            proceed as planned as she managed to stave off seven coup attempts. Furthermore, many Filipinos believed
            that they should leave the American bases in the Philippines (Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base).

        <div class="blog-content">In 1992 Fidel Ramos became president. He enhanced the Philippines' infrastructure,
            notably the electrical supply. After the industry was privatized, the economy began to grow at a faster
            rate. The Philippine economy, on the other hand, had a crisis around the end of the 1990s. Meanwhile,
            Joseph
            Estrada was elected president in 1998. Estrada was impeached in November 2000 after being accused of
            corruption. Estrada was found not guilty. Despite this, protests against him took place, and the
            military
            withdrew its backing. Estrada was forced to resign and was replaced by Vice President Gloria
            Macapagal-Arroyo. In 2004, she was re-elected.</div><br>
