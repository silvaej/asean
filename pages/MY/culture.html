        <div class="blog-content">Modern Malaysia is characterized as a melting pot. Aspects from ancient Malay,
            British,
            Dutch, Portuguese, and Hindu culture still prevail throughout many parts of the country, which
            has led to vast diversity in local architecture, religion, language, and cuisine. Britain’s labor-
            migration policies of the 19th century created a large wave of Chinese and Indian migrant workers.
            Today, descendants of these laborers make up over 30 percent of the population, which is only
            surpassed by the 52 percent Malay population.</div>

        <div class="blog-content">Despite the diversity that exists, the Malaysian government released a controversial
            policy
            known as the ‘National Cultural Policy’ with the goal of developing a united national cultural
            identity, in which the government has accepted Malay as the official culture. This has caused
            upheaval at times, especially in the non-Malayan communities like the Indian and Chinese citizens.</div>
