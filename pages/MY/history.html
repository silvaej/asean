        <br>
        <div class="blog-content">Long before European colonial powers dreamed of occupying Southeast Asia, modern day
            Malaysia was ruled by several empires, the Srivijaya and Majapahit kingdoms, followed by the Melaka
            Sultanate. The earlier reigns saw the spread of Hindu influences across the peninsula and archipelago.
            Islam, the primary religion today, was introduced by Arab traders during the height of the Melaka Sultanate.

        <div class="blog-content">In the 16th century, the Portuguese were the first country to establish settlements
            throughout the Malay Peninsula, primarily around Malacca. However, the Dutch took control soon after, which
            spread their stronghold of Southeast Asia even further. In 1786, British forces set up a colony on the
            island of Penang, and eventually obtained many other parts of the Malay region, including Singapore by 1819.
            The Dutch eventually ceded much of the area the British. In response, British forces ceded all colonies in
            Sumatra (Indonesia) to the Dutch, which was the agreement forged in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824. As a
            result, a line was drawn between British Malay colonies and the Dutch East Indies. Malaysia saw a huge
            influx of Chinese and Indian laborers when Britain took charge.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="blog-content">Before WWII, the regions of Malaysia were mostly governed by Britain, including the
            Federated and Unfederated Malay States, Northern Borneo, Kingdom of Sarawak and Brunei.
            However, some of these were protectorates instead of crown colonies, like Brunei. During WWII,
            British forces quickly fell to the technologically advanced Japanese armies and lost the region until
            the Japanese surrendered in 1945, when Britain took back control of the Malay states. The Malayan
            Union was formed in 1946, which limited the states sultans’ powers, creating local upheaval.

            Eventually, some control was returned to the former state leaders in 1948, and the Malayan Union
            once again changed its title to the Federation of Malaya.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="blog-content">Malaysia first gained independence from Britain in 1957, just 12 years after WWII. For
            the
            first six years, the country was known as Malaya. However, this changed in 1963, as the nation of
            Malaysia as born, adopting states like Sabah, Singapore, and Sarawak. Just two years following
            though, Singapore was expelled as a result of large ethic riots due to the growing threat of Chinese
            influences on the land and Singapore became an independent nation.</div>
        <br>
        <div class="blog-content">Travelers can learn more about the ancient and modern history of Malaysia at the
            National
            Museum (Jalan Damansara, City Center, Kuala Lumpur). Penang’s War Museum (Mukin 12, Batu
            Maung, Penang) is a great place to explore British colonial war tactics and influences. Information
            about the British settlement in Penang is also available at the Penang State Museum (Lebuh
            Farquhar, Pulau Pinang, Penang).</div>
