    <div class="synop">Malaysia is a multicultural country with much to offer visitors-regardless of their budget or what their idea of fun might be. Kuala Lumpur, the country's capital, is a cosmopolitan city with amazing shopping and stunning architecture-within blocks, you'll find both the ultramodern Petronas Towers and a number of colonial palaces and buildings. Just a short drive away from the capital, there are plenty of things to do-from islands, mountains, and record-breaking caves, to countless temples and a unique chance to explore the fauna-rich jungle of Borneo. Malaysia is also a popular destination for snorkeling and scuba diving, with beautiful coral reefs and soft sandy beaches that regularly make top destinations lists.</div>

                            Petronas reach an impressive 452 meters high up into the clouds. The towers are 88 floors
                            tall and have an impressive total of 76 elevators.
                            Built using reinforced concrete, steel, and glass, the two towers are connected to each
                            other by a double skybridge on the 41st and 42nd floors. Visitors can make their way up here
                            for stunning views of KL and the 6.9-hectare KLCC Park below-the views are particularly
                            impressive at night.
                            While most of the floors on the towers are rented to companies-IBM, Microsoft, and Huawei
                            Technologies all have offices here-the bottom floors of the towers are reserved for Suria
                            KLCC, one of the largest shopping centers in Malaysia. With over 300 stores, an art gallery,
                            and even space for a Philharmonic Hall, this retail and entertainment space will keep
                            visitors occupied for hours.

                            complex consists of three main caves plus a series of smaller ones, most of them containing
                            statues and 100-year-old shrines dedicated to Hindu gods.
                            The main cave, known as Cathedral Cave, is at the top of a massive colorful staircase-make
                            it all the way up the 272 steps, and you'll find a space decorated with statues, altars, and
                            lights. At the bottom of the stairs, a 43-meter-tall gold statue of Lord Murugan welcomes
                            visitors.
                            Visitors are allowed to explore the caves on their own or can join a guided tour to learn
                            more about the caves. During the Hindu festival of Thaipusam in January, thousands of people
                            flock to the cave for the celebrations

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At just over 4,000 meters high, Mount Kinabalu is the tallest
                            mountain in Malaysia. The mountain is part of Kinabalu Park, one of the oldest national
                            parks in Malaysia and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Because of its unique ecosystem mixing
                            alpine meadows, grasslands, and shrublands, Kinabalu is home to an impressive range of both
                            plant and animal species, including the threatened orangutans.
                            Mount Kinabalu is a major destination for climbers-but summiting here can be tricky. Only
                            185 climb permits are issued daily by the park, and visitors must make accommodation
                            reservations and hire a mountain guide in advance in order to be allowed to hit the trails.
                            Although people under 16 are allowed to join climbing groups, there are restrictions in
                            place.
                            Climbers should plan a stay at the Kinabalu National Park before attempting the climb-since
                            the park itself is already at an altitude of over 1,800 meters, this will allow for
                            acclimatization before attempting to reach the peak.

                            traveling around Southeast Asia, this group of small islands is part of a marine park and
                            has become a major tourist destination in northeastern Malaysia. Most of the islands can be
                            accessed by either ferry or small motorized boats, although only the two larger islands
                            offer accommodations, shops, and amenities-of these two, Pulau Perhentian Besar has more of
                            a backpacking scene, while Pulau Perhentian Kecil is a little more upscale and
                            family-oriented.
                            While you can hop on a water taxi to move from one beach to the next here, it's also
                            possible to follow the island's walking trails instead-a much-recommended option as you get
                            to trek through jungle paths and get open stunning views of the water along the way.
                            Scuba diving, snorkeling, and kayaking are popular activities here, but visitors can also
                            volunteer in turtle conservation programs and get unique access to the areas where turtles
                            come to lay eggs.

                            monitor lizards, and hundreds of coral species. The island is also considered one of the
                            best diving destinations in the world and is fiercely protected-visiting requires a permit
                            in advance and only 120 permits are given out per day.
                            Reaching the island requires an hour-long ride on a speed boat. Once here, the island can be
                            easily explored on foot, with different beaches and reef sites within minutes of each other.
                            Since it's no longer possible to stay on the island because of environmental protection laws
                            (the nearby Mabul Island offers accommodations), visitors usually come here early in the
                            morning as part of snorkeling and diving tours. All visitors must leave the island by 3pm.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This UNESCO World Heritage Site might be more famous for its
                            impressive karst limestone pinnacles that resemble people standing in large formations, but
                            the park's massive caves are just as stunning.
                            Thick rain forest covers most of the park and makes some areas difficult to access-one of
                            the reasons some of the caves here weren't really explored until the 1970s. Another reason
                            is how massive the cave systems are: both the largest passage and the largest underground
                            chamber in the world are located in caves here.
                            Deer Cave is particularly beautiful, with ceilings over 122 meters tall, waterfalls
                            cascading through the rocks, and an opening over a sinkhole that's over one kilometer wide.
                            Visitors to the park can also trek up to the Sarawak Chamber and Paku Waterfall or try a
                            climb up on The Pinnacles Summit Trek, which takes three days and involves ropes, ladders,
                            and an arduous walk through the jungle.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Center was founded in
                            1964 to help orphaned orangutan babies rescued from the pet trade or saved from illegal
                            hunting. The center's main goal is to help these orangutans learn how to survive in the wild
                            (in fact, replacing what they would usually learn from their mothers), so they can be
                            eventually released into the Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve, which is covered in virgin
                            forest and extends for 4,300 hectares around the rescue center. Over 80 orangutans currently
                            live free in the reserve.
                            While visitors cannot interact with the animals or approach them, they can come to the
                            center to learn more about orangutans and the challenges they face today, see the nursery
                            and the climbing area through a glass window, and attend feeding times (seen from a
                            platform) twice a day.
                            The boardwalk that cuts through the center offers plenty of opportunities to explore and see
                            the orangutans playing and jumping around on the trees nearby.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malaysia's largest Buddhist temple sits on a hill, at the
                            bottom of Air Itam mountain. As Asian temples go, Kek Lok Si is relatively new, as
                            construction began in 1890-but the massive seven-story Pagoda surrounded by 10,000 Buddha
                            statues make this a striking destination that can't be missed.
                            Surrounded by gardens, fish ponds, prayer halls, and a number of stalls selling both
                            religious and secular souvenirs, the pagoda is also home to a 36-meter-tall statue of Kwan
                            Yin, the Buddhist goddess of mercy.
                            The temple attracts many visitors from all around Southeast Asia who come here to "make
                            merits" but also to see one of the most important pilgrimage sites in the area. Chinese New
                            Year celebrations are particularly beautiful at the temple, as the entire space is decorated
                            with thousands of lanterns.

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bako National Park sits right against the water, sandy
                            beaches, and steep sandstone cliffs surrounding the beautiful mangroves and peat swamp
                            forests. Reaching the park requires taking a bus followed by a 20-minute ride on a small
                            motorboat that's not for the faint of heart.
                            Once at the shore, you can follow any of the 16 marked trails on the island to help you
                            explore (there's no transportation within the park) and hopefully catch sight of the unusual
                            local flora and fauna, which includes carnivorous plants, the endangered proboscis monkeys,
                            and the rare and friendly bearded pig. Two of the best trails include the Lintang Loop for
                            great sightseeing on relatively easy terrain, and the Tajor trail, which takes you to a
                            waterfall and pools you can swim in.
                            To better appreciate the beauty of the park, consider staying overnight, as most animals
                            only come out once the sun sets. There are bungalows for rent as well as a designated
                            campsite at the park headquarters.
