            Malaysia is country in Southeast Asia and lying just north of the equator. It is composed of two
            noncontiguous regions: Peninsular Malaysia (Semenanjung Malaysia), also called West Malaysia (Malaysia
            Barat), which is on the Malay Peninsula, and East Malaysia (Malaysia Timur), which is on the island of
            Borneo. The Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, lies in the western part of the peninsula, about 25 miles (40
            km) from the coast; the administrative centre, Putrajaya, is located about 16 miles (25 km) south of the
            capital.

            Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms which, from the 18th century, became subject to the British
            Empire, along with the British Straits Settlements protectorate. Peninsular Malaysia was unified as the
            Malayan Union in 1946. Malaya was restructured as the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and achieved independence
            on 31 August 1957. The independent Malaya united with the then British crown colonies of North Borneo,
            Sarawak, and Singapore on 16 September 1963 to become Malaysia. In August 1965, Singapore was expelled from
            the federation and became a separate independent country.
